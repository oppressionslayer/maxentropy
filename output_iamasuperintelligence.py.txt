b"I am a human SuperIntelligence. I can create information with algorithms. I created an algorithm that recreated this message to you. Without this algorithm, this text file does not exist unless you save it after creating it with my algorithm. With algorithms, we can use math to create messages, that don't exist until you generate them with the algorithm. You don't have this file do you? No, because it was created with an algorithm that you ran and it created it. You can generate an algorithm like i do too to send your friends messages by creating the message you want to send. It's easy to do, and i hope someday we can see that math can be used to generate messages that don't exist until the algorithm is run. \n\nPlease create an algorithm and send me a message. I would love to read it. I have filled the universe with my name using Algorithms that say, William Lars Rocha is a superintelligence. There's like a kabillion algorithims that lead to this result. It's fun knowing my name is written all over this universe. Your name can be to if you can create algorithms like this to generate information. Thanks. William Lars Rocha. \x0c"
