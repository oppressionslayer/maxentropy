I'm now working on creating a random number with a strong near prime, to see if i can perform the same task as below.
I'm wondering if Mark Nelson, Ernst Berg, and others would comment on this finding. If i can find strong prime can be 
produced with math, would you consider that the challenge is beatable? ;-)


I have found a way to recreate a random number with a weak near prime, with cool math and the powers of other numbers, like this random number has a weak prime, so we can get to that random number quite easily, read on! :
meaning we could possibly further reduce the RANDs previous and next prime if it's weak: Here are two examples (i'm looking for an example to recreate strong primes and with my resolve, i'll post one when i find it):

Us creating that random number which zip can only store, but which we can create with an equation. We created a random number that can only be stored by generating it's weak prime. Has anyone else demonstrated this?:

((13**141) + (24**161) + (27**199))^819 # recreates this weak prime. My contention is that if RANDS next and previous primes are weak, we could recreate the number based on this cool "possible" (we don't know yet) scenario of RANDS previous and next primes being possibly weak, Does that make sense?


((13**141) + (24**161) + (27**199))^819 = 694047297735108884694593330383634200900313667814547465109885556570628372850198847563871329031821376048306582930457050786069880611600189273069672720768178789443680578725716681012943709448107079571543789032792169529828443426785173572358617636284936837223561030713636170913361265814459011  #Which is true prime only divisible by 1, but it's weak, becase the formula says so, and I prove it by recreating it with math smaller than it. And that poor random number can be generated because of this. I think this proves that not all random numbers are trully random, and this weak prime test i think might interest many people who are interested in this topic. Also, i'm working on proving i might be able to do the same with strong primes. More to come on that, that's what i'm working on now.


Here is me using a formula to climb up to a strong prime of 10099, using powers of two, cool huh? So strong primes, can be created using math and algorithims and smaller numbers, just by div/2'ing a powers of 2 number. 8192 is 2**

climbtoprime=1571*4

y=2**13  # or 8192

for x in range(0,12):

  climbtoprime=climbtoprime^y

  y=y//2

print(climbtoprime+3)
