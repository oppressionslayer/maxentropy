 My previous post proved there are weak random numbers that have weak primes that can be generated by short math
 using powers (num**num), etc. I think you may find it of interest that i just found a random number with a strong 
 prime ( i got a true on the prime test this time ), and i can create that strong prime with math much smaller than 
 the weak prime!  Would this help you believe that your challenge is beatable. I don't claim i can beat it, but i want
 to know if this changes your mind in any way. I think i'm far from beating the challenge, i don't have the CPU power to 
 do it, and it takes a lot of math trying to get to primes, but i'm hoping to make you a believer that someone like googles
 alpha go, could do it. Regardless if  RANDs next prime is weak or strong. 

This is theory, i'm generating these theories to prove a point, and i hope that point is to make believers of this challenge that it is beatable. Also, i wonder what the NSA thinks of this, lol.

Here's the link to the weak primes: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppressionslayer/maxentropy/master/creatingrandomnumberswithweaknearprimes.txt

I can recreate the above random number near it's strong primes with the following formulas:

127**127^913 
127**127^226

Finding the formula to get to the prime next to RANDs number will be difficult. This is just an exploration and theory on the topic
which i hope helps prove that the challenge is beatable, with the right math. My previous article shows a weak prime and weak
random number.  Finding the math is hard. Proving the math is possible is easier, which is what i'm hoping to do with this series
of articles.
